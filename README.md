# Super Crate Box DS

A very broken recreation of Super Crate Box that I made for HackNotts 21 (https://devpost.com/software/super-crate-box-ds/)

First of all, **THIS RECREATION IS NOT AFFILIATED IN ANY WAY WITH THE ORIGINAL GAME OR VLAMBEER**.

As said in the Devpost page, the game is not complete and mostly doesn't work. Look there if you want some more info about this, as well as a screenshot/picture of it.

A precompiled .nds file can be found in the [Releases page](https://github.com/UnicornsOnLSD/super-crate-box-ds/releases/latest).

`source/linked_list.c` and `source/linked_list.h` were from one of my lecturers, hence why the structs have `Jamie` in them.
